## Capabilities
WaifuAI gives natural and surprisingly human-like responses has a long-term memory and the capability to synchronize with the user's personality, resulting in a personalized experience tailored to each individual. It uses a fine tuned GPT-3 model as the base which is complimented by the internal knowledge base and memories. It has a "self-model" knowledge base which contains everything that WaifuAI knows about herself(including what she is wearing). It also maintains a knowledge-base about the user and as the relation of user increases with WaifuAI, it gains more and more knowledge about the user and their interests.

## Release
It was meant to be a product but I didn't release it due to ethical concerns. I am planing on making some of it open source here. You are requested to give a star to this repository.
